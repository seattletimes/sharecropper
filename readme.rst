Sharecropper
============

A tool for rapidly creating cropped images with the correct aspect ratio for a WordPress teaser. Using this tool is a three-step process:

1. Drag a photo onto the white square in the middle of the screen.
2. Select a preset aspect ratio from the drop-down on the right, and drag out your crop selection on the image.
3. Press the "download" button to get a cropped version.

You may get an error if you try to create a cropped image that would be too small for a given image size. If so, either increase the size of the crop, or use a higher-resolution image to make sure there's sufficient detail for the final output.
